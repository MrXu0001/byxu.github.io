Document image translation (DIT) aims to translate text embedded in images from one language to another.
It is a challenging task that needs to understand visual layout with text semantics simultaneously.
However, existing methods struggle to capture the crucial visual layout in real-world complex document images.
In this work, we make the first attempt to incorporate layout knowledge into DIT in an end-to-end way.
Specifically, we propose a novel Layout-aware end-to-end Document Image Translation (LayoutDIT) with multi-step conductive decoder.
A layout-aware encoder is first introduced to model visual layout relations with raw OCR results.
Then a novel multi-step conductive decoder is unified with hidden states conduction across three step-decoders to achieve the document translation step by step.
Benefiting from the layout-aware end-to-end joint training, our LayoutDIT outperforms state-of-the-art methods with better parameter efficiency.
Besides, we create a new multi-domain document image translation dataset to validate the modelâ€™s generalization.
Extensive experiments show that LayoutDIT has a good generalization in diverse and complex layout scenes.
