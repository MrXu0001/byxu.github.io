Text image machine translation (TIMT) is a task that translates source texts embedded in the image to target translations. 
The existing TIMT task mainly focuses on text-line-level images. 
In this paper, we extend the current TIMT task and propose a novel task, Document Image Machine Translation to Markdown (DIMT2Markdown), which aims to translate a source document image with long context and complex layout structure to markdown-formatted target translation.
We also introduce a novel framework, Document Image Machine Translation with Dynamic multi-pre-trained models Assembling (DIMTDA).
A dynamic model assembler is used to integrate multiple pre-trained models to enhance the modelâ€™s understanding of layout and translation capabilities.
Moreover, we build a novel large-scale Document image machine Translation dataset of ArXiv articles in markdown format (DoTA), containing 126K image-translation pairs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the feasibility of end-to-end translation of rich-text document images and the effectiveness of DIMTDA.
